==========

This project aims to provide me with a means to quickly request and retrieve movie information from the API provided from Brian Fritz which can be found at http://www.omdbapi.com/

The database is owned and maintained by him and I take no claim of ownership of the service, I am simply using the service and developing a series of applications which will access the data for educational purposes. 

The project at the moment has a simple python program that retrieves data through the console with key words such as "Iron Man" or any other movie title. The program then retrieves a JSON file to display the data. 

The project also has a web application that does a similiar task.
